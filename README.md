# Process Workshops

A selection of exercises from the [Process Workshops](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/process_review) at Makers.

The format of a process workshop is to pair up and spend 30 mins observing your partner recording their screen and TDDing an exercise, while you use a rubric to note down what and how they do in order to give them useful feedback. You then swap over roles; youâ€™ll record your screen and TDD an exercise for 30 mins while your partner observes to give you feedback at the end.
